o you've now reached the end of week one. Congratulations. What I find really inspiring about this particular week was that what you've just done with the cats versus dogs datasets as a Kaggle data science challenge, not that long ago was really only available to the top view, the best researchers at the best universities. But now, thanks to the explosion in compute power, open datasets such as this one, and things such as TensorFlow, you're actually able to do this by yourself, on your own home computer. I find that really inspiring and really exciting. So thank you and get ready for week two.
